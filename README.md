### Key Components
- **WalletContextProvider**: Solana wallet integration
- **Navigation**: Top navigation with wallet connection
- **Feed**: Main content feed with posts
- **CreatePost**: Modal for creating new posts
- **CreateProfileModal**: Profile creation with IPFS uploads
- **UserProfile**: Profile display and management
- **Sidebar**: Navigation and community discovery

### IPFS Integration
- **Development**: Mock IPFS uploads for testing
- **Production**: Pinata service integration
- **Utilities**: File validation, preview generation
- **Storage**: Decentralized image hosting

### Smart Contract Integration
The frontend connects to your deployed Solana program using:
- **Program ID**: Configured in `hooks/useBlocksProgram.ts`
- **Instructions**: Borsh serialization for contract calls
- **PDAs**: Program Derived Addresses for data storage

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file:
```bash
# Required
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROGRAM_ID=your_program_id

# Optional (for production IPFS)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt_token
NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_GATEWAY=your_pinata_gateway_url
```

### Wallet Network
Ensure your Phantom wallet is set to **Devnet** for testing.

### IPFS Setup (Production)
1. Sign up at [Pinata Cloud](https://pinata.cloud)
2. Generate API keys
3. Add keys to your `.env.local`
4. Uncomment production upload function in `utils/ipfs.ts`

## üö® Important Notes

- **Devnet Only**: This is configured for Solana devnet testing
- **Mock IPFS**: Development uses simulated IPFS uploads
- **Gas Fees**: Transactions require SOL for gas fees
- **Image Storage**: IPFS ensures permanent, decentralized storage
- **Beta Software**: This is experimental software for testing

## üîó IPFS Features

### Current Implementation
- **Mock Uploads**: Simulated IPFS hashes for development
- **File Validation**: Type and size checking
